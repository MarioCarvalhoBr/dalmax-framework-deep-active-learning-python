class WindowSplitter():

    def split(self, image: np.ndarray, **kwargs) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Splits the given image into smaller windows of specified size, with optional padding.

        This function divides an image into smaller square windows, each of the size specified
        by the 'window_size' keyword argument. If the 'padding' keyword argument is set to True,
        the image is padded on all sides to ensure that every pixel can be the center of a window.
        The function returns these windows as a reshaped NumPy array.

        Args:
            image (np.ndarray): The input image to be split into windows. This should be a 2D array.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments, where:
                - 'window_size' (int): The size of each square window. Must be specified.
                - 'padding' (bool, optional): If True, pads the image before splitting. Defaults to False.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If 'window_size' is not provided in the keyword arguments.

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: A reshaped NumPy array where each row represents a flattened window of the
                        original image. The number of rows corresponds to the number of windows,
                        and each row has a length of `window_size`**2.

        # This process guarantees that each extracted window is fully contained within the image.
        #
        # If padding is applied (when 'padding' is set to True), each pixel of the image,
        # including those on the borders, becomes the center of a window. This results in

        # the image's edges.

        # contains the flattened pixel values of a window. The number of columns in each row
        # is the square of 'windows.shape[1]', which represents the total number of pixels in each window.
